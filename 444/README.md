# This week's question

You have a 2D grid of numbers. Write a function that zooms in by an integer factor k >= 2 by turning each cell into a k x k block with the same value, returning the bigger grid.

Examples:

```text
zoom([[1,2],[3,4]], 2)
[
  [1,1,2,2],
  [1,1,2,2],
  [3,3,4,4],
  [3,3,4,4]
]

zoom([[7,8,9]], 3)
[
  [7,7,7,8,8,8,9,9,9],
  [7,7,7,8,8,8,9,9,9],
  [7,7,7,8,8,8,9,9,9]
]

zoom([[1],[2]], 3)
[
  [1,1,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [2,2,2],
  [2,2,2],
  [2,2,2]
]
```
